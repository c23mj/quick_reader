## Credit
Quick Reader is a project that was inspired by [Bionic Reading®](https://bionic-reading.com/). Note, however, that it does not in any way make use of the Bionic Reading® API - instead, the algorithm reimplements code from the open-source developers of [jiffy reader](https://github.com/ansh/jiffyreader.com), [fastread](https://github.com/ahrm/chrome-fastread),  and [bionify](https://github.com/Cveinnt/bionify). Many thanks to all of these developers for making this mini-project possible for me!
